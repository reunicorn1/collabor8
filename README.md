## Running the Project

This project consists of both a frontend (ReactJS) and a backend (NestJS) application. 

To run the project, you can use the provided `Makefile`, which utilizes `tmux` to manage the sessions.

This `Makefile` provides a convenient way to manage your development workflow, from setting up the environment to running, stopping, and testing the application.
Hereâ€™s how to get started:

#### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- **tmux**: A terminal multiplexer.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager.

You can verify their installation using:
```bash
tmux -V
npm -v
```

If any of the prerequisites are missing, the setup process will attempt to install them.

#### Setup

To install the necessary dependencies and set up the project, run:
```bash
make setup
```

This command will install `tmux` and `npm` if they are not already installed and will install all necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

#### Running the Application

To run both the frontend and backend in separate `tmux` sessions, use:
```bash
make run
```

This command starts:
- **ReactJS** in a `tmux` session named `ReactJS`.
- **NestJS** in a `tmux` session named `NestJS`.

#### Running Individually

If you want to run only the frontend or backend, you can use the following commands:

- To run the frontend:
  ```bash
  make run_react
  ```

- To run the backend:
  ```bash
  make run_nest
  ```

#### Stopping the Application

To stop both the frontend and backend `tmux` sessions, use:
```bash
make stop
```

If you want to stop only one of the sessions:
- To stop the frontend session:
  ```bash
  make stop_react
  ```
- To stop the backend session:
  ```bash
  make stop_nest
  ```

#### Checking the Status

To list all running `tmux` sessions, use:
```bash
make list
```

To check the status of the sessions:
```bash
make status
```

#### Cleaning Dependencies

To remove and reinstall all dependencies:
```bash
make clean
```

#### Running Tests

To run tests for both the frontend and backend:
```bash
make test
```

You can also run tests individually:
- For frontend tests:
  ```bash
  make test_frontend
  ```
- For backend tests:
  ```bash
  make test_backend
  ```

#### Docker

To build Docker images for the frontend and backend:
```bash
make docker-build
```

To push these Docker images to a repository:
```bash
make docker-push
```

#### Project Information

To view project version and scripts:
```bash
make version
make info
```

#### Help

To display all available commands:
```bash
make help
```
